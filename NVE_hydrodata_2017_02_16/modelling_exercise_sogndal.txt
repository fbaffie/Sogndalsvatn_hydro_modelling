- get the data online
- organise the data so that it's ready to be used for modelling

- use the rational method: estimate areas with different coefficients of infiltration in the catchment
- calibration / validation

- use the linear reservoir method

- use a temperature index snowmelt model

- use a landscape-based 3-component model (see Prof. Hubert Savenije: Breakthroughs in landscape-based rainfall-runoff)

- use HBV NVE
